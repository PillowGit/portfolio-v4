## Developing

Install packages with `npm install`

Then start running the site with:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

Depending on where you are deploying, you may need to change the [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) before building
